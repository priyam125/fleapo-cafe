              <h3>How To Make A Great Coffee</h3>
              <p class="whiskey-card--content">
                Making a cup of coffee doesn't have to be complicated. Start by
                gathering your supplies: coffee grounds, water, and a French
                press, mug or other vessel. Next, measure out 2 tablespoons of
                ground coffee per 8 ounces of water. If you're using a French
                press, pour the measured grounds into the bottom of the press
                followed by hot water (between 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit). Let
                sit for three minutes before gently pushing down on the filter
                to trap the grounds at the bottom; this will create an intense
                flavor with slightly heavier body than filtered methods. If you
                have neither a French press nor filter, just pour your measured
                grounds directly into a mug or vessel and top with piping hot
                water. Give it a stir and let it sit for 3-4 minutes before
                consuming--but don't leave it too long as this method won't
                produce quite as bold of a flavor as either filtering or
                pressing would!

              <h3>Why Does Caffeine Make Us Stay Awake?</h3>
              <p class="whiskey-card--content">
                Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain,
                which facilitates energy production and makes us feel more
                alert. Caffeine also increases adrenaline levels, further
                boosting your energy and heart rate, as well as other hormones
                like dopamine that can make you feel more awake. The combination
                of these effects makes caffeine a stimulant that is all-too
                common in both food and drinks to give us an extra boost of
                energy when we need it most. It's no wonder why so many people
                rely on caffeinated beverages - it really can make us stay
                awake!

              <p class="whiskey-card--content">
                Coffee is a staple in the lives of many and comes in a variety
                of forms. Whether you prefer hot or iced, espresso-based or
                filter, you’re spoilt for choice. To help beginners navigate
                their first foray into the world of coffee, let’s breakdown some
                basic categories: Espresso is an especially intense type of
                brewed coffee made by forcing pressurized water through finely
                ground beans. It has a strong flavor and can be used to make all
                manner of delicious drinks like flat whites, cappuccinos and
                lattes. Filter coffee is made with a paper filter that holds
                back most grounds before allowing the liquid to drip down into
                your cup. Its taste is less intense than that of espresso but
                still robust enough to serve with milk or flavored syrups if
                desired. Cold brew on the other hand isn't actually brewed using
                heat but rather steeped in cold water overnight to produce a
                smooth yet sweet drink - great over ice! Finally there's nitro
                which takes cold brew and injects it (through nitrogen) with
                carbon dioxide for an even creamier texture and slightly sweet
                flavor profile. No matter what you choose, chances are you won't
                be disappointed!
