              <h3>How To Make A Great Coffee</h3>
              <p class="blog-card--content">
                Making a cup of coffee doesn't have to be complicated. Start by
                gathering your supplies: coffee grounds, water, and a French
                press, mug or other vessel. Next, measure out 2 tablespoons of
                ground coffee per 8 ounces of water. If you're using a French
                press, pour the measured grounds into the bottom of the press
                followed by hot water (between 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit). Let
                sit for three minutes before gently pushing down on the filter
                to trap the grounds at the bottom; this will create an intense
                flavor with slightly heavier body than filtered methods. If you
                have neither a French press nor filter, just pour your measured
                grounds directly into a mug or vessel and top with piping hot
                water. Give it a stir and let it sit for 3-4 minutes before
                consuming--but don't leave it too long as this method won't
                produce quite as bold of a flavor as either filtering or
                pressing would!
